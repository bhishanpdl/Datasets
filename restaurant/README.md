# Description
Restaurant data from Sheila Tejada sent to me by Nick Kushmerick. 

original/ has the original data. 

I currently cannot locate the non-lower-cased and non-un-HTML-ed 
parsed version; will try to find it in archives soon. 

The dataset with the phone numbers is too easy; only matching without
phone numbers makes the dataset useful for comparing algorithms. 

Restaurant - a collection of 864 restaurant records from the Fodor's and Zagat's restaurant guides that contains 112 duplicates. Includes both segmented and unsegmented versions. Provided by Sheila Tejada
